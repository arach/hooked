description: Keep working until tests pass
---

Start an until loop that will keep me working until the tests pass.

First, use the `until_check` tool to set up the loop with the test command for this project.
Then run the tests to see what's failing and start fixing issues.

I will automatically continue working after each stop until the tests pass.
