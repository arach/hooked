description: Keep working until build succeeds
---

Start an until loop that will keep me working until the build passes.

First, use the `until_check` tool to set up the loop with the build command for this project.
Then run the build to see what's failing and start fixing issues.

I will automatically continue working after each stop until the build succeeds.
